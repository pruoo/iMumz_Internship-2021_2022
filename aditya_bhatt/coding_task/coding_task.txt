For creating this page first I made a scrollable column that contains all the widgets of the page.
For the back button on top, I created a row and created a button inside it.
Then I placed all the images and text inside the column.
Then for the referral code section, I made a container that contains the code text and copy icon and used InkWell to copy the text on the clipboard and show SnackBar message that the code is copied.
For the share buttons I made a row and made two containers and using InkWell and share_plus dependency I added the share function. For the WhatsApp icon, I used font_awesome_flutter dependency.
