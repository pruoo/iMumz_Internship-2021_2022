1. Do  you follow any coding patterns/conventions?
A) I like to use indentations to format the code to make it much more readable. I also like to use different files or folders for different screens

2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. How have you managed “state” before?
A) There are two types of states in Flutter: stateless and stateful.  
   Stateless widgets are static and cannot change their state during the runtime of the app. Some examples of Stateless widgets are icons, images, text, etc.
   Stateful widgets are dynamic and can change their state multiple times. Users can interact with the stateful widgets. Some examples of Stateful widgets are checkbox, textbox, radio buttons, etc.

3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process? What’s your approach/outlook when you have to squash a bug?
A) As I am still learning flutter I encounter lots of run-time and compile-time errors whenever I try to work on something new. The first thing I always do is check the logs which tell us more about the error and see if I can fix it myself. Then if it seems like something that I can't fix I copy the error from the log and search it in Google. If I still can't find the solution I usually ask someone I know who can fix it or I ask it online in forums like StackOverflow.

4. Have you written dart/javascript tests before? If yes, tell us more.
A) I haven't written tests for dart or javascript before but I can definitely learn more about it.
