3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process? What’s your approach/outlook when you have to squash a bug?
A) I primarily encounter bugs while integrating some technology in my application.
   I deubg my application in the following manner:-
	- Zero in on the origin of the bug. If origin is not obvious from looking at the bug, remove some functionalitites and then try to find it.
	- Understand the cause and try to resolve it. Here google helps a lot.
	- Add back funcitonality incrementally and check if the bug persists or has led to more bugs.

4. Have you written dart/javascript tests before? If yes, tell us more.
A) I haven't written tests for dart/javascript before, but have used jUnit for testing
   Java applications and written tests for python.
