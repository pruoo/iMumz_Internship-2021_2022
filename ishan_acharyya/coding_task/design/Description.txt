There is a button in the app bar for navigation.
The screen in question is scrollable in the vertical direction so a column and list view are used.
The children are primarily containers to contain text and allow for styling the borders and colors.
I have made use of the following widgets:
	- Scaffold
	- Container
	- Row
	- Column
	- Text, RichText
	- RawMaterialButton
	- Icon
	- GestureDetector
	- ListView
	- Image
	- Divider
	- SizedBox
	- DottedBorder
	- InkWell
	
The widget tree would look like:
Scaffold
	Column
		ListView
			//For Text
			Container
				Text/RichText
			
			//For Image
			Image
			
			//For Some component with a particular arrangement of texts
			Container			
				Row/Column
					Text/Icon
				Repeat
			
				
Added padding wherever necessary
