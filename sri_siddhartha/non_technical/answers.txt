1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) I follow a lot of forums and pages on instagram, servers on discord and communicate with people interested in app development especially flutter.
	I also follow the official handles of flutter and google for updates and version changes to keep up with the changes 
	, official documentation for flutter as its a great place to learn more, youtube and online tech events.
	I am also a member in my college google developers student club App Dev department (GDSC-VITC)

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart/Typescript)
A) I personally prefer using visual studio code as its easy and has a lot of features that help in development. 
	My most used short cut is cntrl+s which saves the file and also hot reloads the application.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when writing code for an entire screen? 
A)  When the UI/UX component enables interaction using mediaquery of the Screen context or layoutbuilder or dimensions inherited using Keys helps
	to enable potrait and landscape mode. Mediaquery is a genral solution for height and width of the component as we can manipulate the ratio
	and make it more responsive and also viable for different sizes of phones. Certain widgets might not require responsive or dynamic dimensions
	which can be made static valued by trial and error
